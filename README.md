# 05-Work-Day-Scheduler-Challenge-5

## Description
The purpose of this project was to build a dynamic work day scheduler that allows the user to save items according to the time they want. On revisiting the site or refreshing it, the save items will populate in the same area they were saved in. The dynamic part of this project is updating the background color to indicate if that hour is in the past, present or future. The challenges faced in this project were to link and apply third party APIs. The most difficult part was understanding each APIs advantages and weaknesses and leveraging it to complete my application. 

A link to the deployed application can be found [here](https://kyleochata.github.io/05-Work-Day-Scheduler-Challenge-5/).
